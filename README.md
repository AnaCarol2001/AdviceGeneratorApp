## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap/CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Async/Await
- [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### What I learned

This project was an opportunity to try out the CSS framework Bootstrap. It was easier than expected after getting used to the classes names. Additionally, I learned about promises, then, and async/await functions, which allowed me to access data from an API successfully.


### Continued development

- Since Bootstrap makes it easy and faster to design web applications, I plan to use it in future projects. 

- I will also continue studying APIs and async/await functions to understand these essential concepts better. 

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 CheatSheet](https://bootstrap-cheatsheet.themeselection.com/) - Easer way to find the bootstrap classes. 
- [Async/await](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/async-await-no-javascript-o-que-e-e-quando-usar) - This is an article which helped me undestand Async/Await.
